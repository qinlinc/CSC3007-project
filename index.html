                <p>The graph shows an overview trend of the total energy produced in USA over the years. The energy produced can be a reliable way to find out about the country economy and well-being. From the graph, we can see that the energy production is stably increasing from 1960 to 2019 but it decreases from 2019 to 2020. The decrease of the energy production from 2019 to 2020 is due to the covid panademic.</p>

                <u><h3>Idiom</h3></u>
                <p>The line graph is able to show the changes of the energy production over the years. It can be seen that USA tends to produce more energy as the country continue to develop. However, due to covid, it produce lesser energy as compared to the previous years. The y axis is labeled with the energy produced and xaxis is labeled with the year. It has tooltip to show the exact numberof energy produced for that particular year. </p>

                <p>The sunburst shows the distribution of the energy produced from different sources in 2020. It can be seen that USA produced a lot of fossil fuels than the nuclear power energy and renewable energy with a percentage of 79%. Fossil Fuels energys are bad source of energy that contributed to global warming. When the fossil fuels are burned, they release large energy of carbon dioxide, also known as the green house gases. The green housegases trap heat in the environment which causes global warming. Among the fossil fuels, natural gas can be seen that it has taken up the highest number of percentage. The gas mainly use in cooking, generating electricity and industrial goods andmaterial such as glass and clothing. It is also an important ingredient ofa plastic. Following is the crude oil that has a higher number of production. Crude oil helps in the transportation in US and producedindustrial good. Coal, which has the lowest production among the bad source of energy, is used to generate electricity.</p>

                <p>The visualisation is the sunburst chart that help to categories each source of energy produced to better visualise proportion of bad source of energy to good source of energy. It split different source of energy into different colour which help user better differentiate the type that the energy belongs to. An interactivity tooltip is implemented to allow user to see the exact value of each type energy isproduced. Percentage is calculated to allow user to compare thevisualisation with a number. </p>

                <u><h3>Idiom</h3></u>
                <p>The visualisation is a leaflet map that helps to display the amount of energy produced in the different state through the usage of color hue. Darker color represents more energy is produced. Upon hovering over marked area, a dark border will appear with a tooltip. The tooltip contained information of the production for different source of energy for the state hovered. Pan and zoom can be performed through drag and scroll, additionally, clicking on a state will zoom in and clicking the same state will cause the map to pan out.</p>

                <p>The graph shows the total energy produced and consumed in US by State. From the visualization, it can be seen that Texas produced the most and also consumed the most energy.As it leads the nation in energy consumption across all sectors, it is the largest energy-consuming state in the nation. Energy consuming is tied to the population staying in the state. For states that have produced more energy than energy consumed, it shows that there are more power plants and lesser residential housing.</p>

                <p>The visualization is represented in a double sided horizontal bar chart. It depicts the total energy produced and consumed by different state across US.

                <p>The process of discovering and exploring the dataset characteristic and its story can be very intriguing. However, it is difficult when come to visualisation. There are many resources available to us and it is hard to choose one that suit our case most. There are many different way to present the data and the chart used varies based on our perspective and the story we trying to tell.</p>
