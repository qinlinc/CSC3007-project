    <h1>US Total Production and Consumption by State</h1>
    <h4>Year 2020</h4>
    <p>The graph shows the total energy produced and consumed in US by State.
        From the visualization, it can be seen that Texas produced the most and also consumed the most energy.
        As it leads the nation in energy consumption across all sectors, it is the largest energy-consuming state in the
        nation.
        For states that have produced more energy than energy consumed, it shows that there are more power plants and
        lesser residential housing.
        <br />
    </p>
    <p><b>Data-Task-Idiom</b><br />
        Data:
        <li>Ratio - (1) Amount of energy produced (2) Amount of energy consumed</li>
        <li>Ordinal - State</li>
        Task: <br />The visualization shows the total energy produced and consumed by different state across US in 2020.
        <br />
        Idiom: <br />The visualization is represented in a double sided horizontal bar chart. It depicts the total
        energy produced and consumed
        by different state across US. The state is plotted against the y-axis and the total energy production and total
        energy consumption are
        plotted against the left and right hand side of the x-axis respectively.
