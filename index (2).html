                <p>The graph shows an overview trend of the total energy produced each year.From the graph, we can see that the energy production is increasing from1960 to 2019 but it decreases from 2019 to 2020. The decrease of theenergy production from 2019 to 2020 is due to the covid panademic.</p>

                <p>The line graph is able to show the changes of the energy production overthe years. It can be seen that US tends to produce more energy as timesgoes by however, due to covid, it produce lesser energy as compared tothe previous years. The y axis is labeled with the energy produced and xaxis is labeled with the year. It has tooltip to show the exact numberof energy produced for that particular year. </p>

                <p>The sunburst shows the energy produce from different categories in 2020.Based on the graph, we are able to see the distribution energy of thedifferent categories. It can be seen that US produced a lot of fossilfuels than the nuclear power energy and renewable energy with a percentageof 79%. Fossil Fuels energys are bad sourcc of energy that help to contribute toglobal warming. When the fossil fuels are burned, they release largeenergy of carbon dioxide known as the green house gases. Those green housegases trap heat in the environment which causes global warming. Among the fossil fuels, Naturalgas can be seen that it has taken up the highest number of percentage. Those gasmainly use in cooking, generating electricity and industrial goods andmaterial such as glass and clothing. It is also an important ingredient ofa plastic. Following is the crude oil that has a higher number ofproduction. Crude oil helps in the transportation in US and producedindustrial good. Coal, which has the lowest production among the bad source of energy, is used to generate electricity.</p>

                <p>The visualisation is the sunburst chart that help to categories eachtype of energy produced to better visualise if the energy produced is abad source of energy or good source of energy. It split different category of energy intodifferent colour which help user better differientitate what kind ofenergy each type of energy belong to. An interactivity tooltip isimplement to allow user to see the exact value of each type energy isproduced. Percentage is calculated to allow user to compare thevisualisation with a number. </p>

                <p>The visualisation is a leaflet map that helps to display the amount of energy produced in the different state through the usage of color hue.
